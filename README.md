# 100 Days Of ML

## Joining the movement kickstarted by Siraj Reval. One hour of ML everyday

### Day 0: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Removed my old python installation and realised why it's a good idea to use virtual environments. Finally set up conda with 2 virtual envs for different versions of python.

**Thoughts:** It took a fair amount of time to understand and grasp the concept of virtualenv, but totally worth it. Shout out to Gergely Szerovay for explaining everything so well.

### Day 1: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Retraced Siraj Reval's [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llSourcell/prepare_dataset_challenge/) to get a better understanding of what lies ahead. Only understood half of it. The next step is to learn tensorflow in isolation for a bit. Need to be more careful with using github, cause I somehow ended up deleting the last changes from local directory.

**Thoughts:** Moving from c# to python is not easy, but it's happening. While the basic syntax is not very different, things are just done very differently in python. It's annoying, but has to be done.

### Day 2: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started learning tensorflow basics. Apparently Tensorflow's ability to make calculations only when needed is super useful.

**Thoughts:** Still quite faraway from understanding why Tensorflow is the winner when it comes to deep learning.

### Day 3: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Still playing with the basics of Tensorflow. Learnt how to use Jupyter notebook, placeholders, see visualisations on Tensorboard etc.

**Thoughts:** Wow, this is slow. The thing is, I am not really sure why I am learning what I am learning. But it's ok.
