# 100 Days Of ML

## Joining the movement kickstarted by Siraj Reval. One hour of ML everyday

### Day 0: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Removed my old python installation and realised why it's a good idea to use virtual environments. Finally set up conda with 2 virtual envs for different versions of python.

**Thoughts:** It took a fair amount of time to understand and grasp the concept of virtualenv, but totally worth it. Shout out to Gergely Szerovay for explaining everything so well.
